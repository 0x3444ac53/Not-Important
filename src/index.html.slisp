            Being me is kind of like
            reading a sequel to the 
            $<(page "https://beinecke.library.yale.edu/collections/highlights/voynich-manuscript" "voynich manuscript")>$, 
            and the entire time there is a crushing feeling of 
            $<(doos "agnosthesia")>$, 
            references to books I've never read and a lot of meandering about 
            $<(doos "midding")>$. There is a trend toward 
            $<(doos "altschmerz")>$ somewhere in the middle, and a longing for 
            $<(concat "" (doos "flashover") "s")>$ that may never come. The 
            $<(doos "liberosis")>$ is palatable. With this last chapter of my life closing there is a focus on 
            $<(doos "adronitis")>$, and a desperation towards creating a new 
            $<(doos "rigor samsa")>$ knowing this will only exacerbate the disconnected 
            $<(doos "sonder")>$ I'm prone to. I do what I can to submit myself to

            and yet whenever I have, I've only felt mortified and never known.
            I can tell people I am in my 1989 era, or my modern philosophy era,
            but I am neither a $<(page "https://open.spotify.com/track/1p80LdxRV74UKvL8gnD7ky" "nightmare dressed like a daydream")>$ nor
